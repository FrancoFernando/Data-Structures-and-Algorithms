Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm.

It partitions an input array into 2 subarrays: one sorted and one unsorted.

At each step the smallest element of the unsorted subarray is inserted into its proper place in the sorted one.

Time complexity is O(N^2). The algorithm makes n-1 iterations.
At the step k, n-k-1 comparisons are executed to find the index of the smallest item.

Space complexity is O(1).
